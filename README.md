# Project: Coffee Machine
### About:
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
### Learning outcomes:
This project allows you to get a taste of Kotlin. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Kotlin.
### This project is a part of the following learning goals:
Kotlin Developer
## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
### Stage 1/6: Hello, coffee!
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!
### Stage 2/6: Machines have needs
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.
### Stage 3/6: Enough coffee for everyone
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.
### Stage 4/6: Action!
Upgrade your knowledge of functions - set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
### Stage 5/6: On a coffee loop
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you press exit.
### Stage 6/6: Brush your code
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
